# Deep Learning Exercises - FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg
## Professor Andreas Maier - Summer Semester 2024

This repository contains my solutions to the Deep Learning exercises assigned in the summer semester of 2024 at Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nürnberg, under the guidance of Professor Andreas Maier.

### Contents
The repository is structured as follows:
- `Exercise_0`: Introduction to Deep Learning tools and setup.
- `Exercise_1`: Basic Neural Network implementations.
- `Exercise_2`: Advanced techniques in training Deep Neural Networks.

### Implementation Status
- **Exercise 0**: Completed and reviewed.
- **Exercise 1**: Completed and reviewed.
- **Exercise 2**: Completed and reviewed.
- **Exercises 3 onwards**: Not implemented due to time constraints associated with other semester commitments.
